Django invitation
=================


This is a fairly simple user-invitation application for Django_,
designed to make allowing user signups as painless as possible
with quota restrictions: you need to be invited by someone else and
the number of invitations is limited by user.

.. _Django: http://www.djangoproject.com/

This particular version has been updated to work with Django 1.5,
which did away with several view/render/url methods and classes, and
changed the way settings are retrieved.


Overview
========

This application enables a common user-invitation workflow:

1. User fills out an invitation form, entering an email address.

2. An invitation code is created, and an invitation link is sent to
   the submitted email address.

3. User clicks the invitation link, the
   user is able to register in and begin contributing to your site.

Various methods of extending and customizing the invitation process
are also provided.


Installation
============

In order to use django-invitation, you will need to have a
functioning installation of Django 1.0 or newer; due to changes needed
to stabilize Django's APIs prior to the 1.0 release,
django-invitation will not work with older releases of Django.


Installing from a Mercurial checkout
------------------------------------

If you have `Mercurial`_ installed on your computer, you can
obtain a complete copy of django-invitation by typing::

    hg clone http://bitbucket.org/jsma/django-invitation/

Inside the resulting "django-invitation" directory will be a
directory named "invitation", which is the actual Python module for
this application; you can symlink it from somewhere on your Python
path. Using a symlink offers easy upgrades: simply running ``hg pull -u``
inside the django-invitation directory will fetch updates from the
main repository and apply them to your local copy.

Basic use
=========

To use the invitation system with all its default settings, you'll
need to do the following:

1. Add ``invitation`` to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting of your
   Django project.

2. Add the setting ``ACCOUNT_INVITATION_DAYS`` to your settings file;
   this should be the number of days invitations will remain valid
   after an invitation is sent. By default, users can send unlimited
   invitations. If you would like to limit the number of invitations,
   add the setting ``INVITATIONS_PER_USER`` to your settings file; 
   this should be an integer that will determine the maximum number 
   of invitations a single user may send.

3. Create the necessary templates (see the section on templates below
   for details).

4. Add this line to your site's root URLConf **before registration urls**::
   
       (r'^accounts/', include('invitation.urls')),

5. Link people to ``/accounts/invite/`` so they can start inviting.


Templates used by django-invitation
===================================

The views included in django-invitation make use of five templates:

* ``invitation/invitation_form.html`` displays the invitation
  form for users to invite contacts.

* ``invitation/invitation_complete.html`` is displayed after the
  invitation email has been sent, to tell the user his contact has been 
  emailed.

* ``invitation/invitation_email_subject.txt`` is used for the
  subject of the invitation email.

* ``invitation/invitation_email.txt`` is used for the body of the
  invitation email.

* ``invitation/accepted.html`` is displayed when a user attempts to
  register his/her account.

* ``invitation/invalid.html`` is displayed if the invitation link was 
  invalid (expired, or bogus invitation code) or if a user attempts
  to send and invitation and they have no remaining invites left.

Examples of these templates are included in the example application.
These are NOT suitable for public use and are only to be used as part
of the example application.

Additionally, the URLConf provided with django-invitation includes
URL patterns for useful views in Django's built-in authentication
application -- this means that a single ``include`` in your root
URLConf can wire up invitation process.


How it works
============

Using the recommended default configuration, the URL
``/accounts/invite/`` will map to the view
``invitation.views.invite``, which displays an invitation form
(an instance of ``invitation.forms.InvitationForm``); this form
asks for an email address. It then does three things:

1. Validates the form to be sure that's a valid email address.

2. Creates an instance of ``invitation.models.Invitation``,
   stores an activation code (a SHA1 hash generated from the username
   of the user sending the invitation plus a randomly-generated "salt").

3. Sends an email to the address they supplied  containing a link
   which can be clicked to register a new account.

For details on customizing this process, including use of alternate
invitation form classes, read the code.

After the activation email has been sent,
``invitation.views.invite`` issues a redirect to the URL
``/accounts/invite/complete/``. By default, this is mapped to the
``direct_to_template`` generic view, and displays the template
``invitation/invitation_complete.html``; this is intended to show
a short message telling the user his/her contact has been emailed.

The invitation link will map to the view
``invitation.views.invitation_accepted``, which will attempt to verify the
activation code.
If the invitation has expired (this is controlled by the setting
``ACCOUNT_INVITATION_DAYS``, as described above), the login page will not 
be reachable (see the section on maintenance below for instructions on 
cleaning out expired invitations which have not been used).

The optional ``INVITATIONS_PER_USER`` setting lets you decide the 
initial number of invitations per user. Each accepted invitation consumes one 
invitation. NOTE: Expired invitations that went unused can be reclaimed and 
reused if you regularly use the recommended cleanup script mentioned below. 
If you wish to allow unlimited invitations, simply do not add this setting.


Maintenance
===========

Inevitably, a site which uses a two-step process for user invitation --
invitation followed by acceptance -- will accumulate a certain
number of invitations which were created but never used. These
invitations clutter up the database, so it's desirable to clean them out
periodically. For this purpose, a `Django command`_,
``cleanupinvitation``, is provided, which is
suitable for use as a regular cron job.
