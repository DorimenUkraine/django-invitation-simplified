This is a very basic example project to demonstrate how django-invitation works.

The templates are un-styled and stripped to the bare essentials and are NOT 
meant to be used outside of this example project.

If you do not have an email server configured for sending the invitations 
(or do not want to send actual email while examining the demo project), 
you can start a dummy SMTP server with the following command:

    sudo python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:25

This will just print the emails to standard output. The example email
messages are short, so it should be easy to find the invitation link. 

Copy and paste this invitation url into your browser to 'accept' the 
invitation and complete the process.

If you do want to send actual email, you will need to add your email server connection
settings to a settings_local.py file in the examples/invitation_project/ directory.
