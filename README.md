django-invitation-simplified
============================

This is a github fork of [jimfmunro][5]'s clone repo for the original [django-invitation][4] authored by [John-Scott Atlakson][1] which is, itself, a modified version of [David Larlet][2]'s [django-invitation][3].

**Description from Bitbucket**:	  

Building on David Larlet's foundation, but removing the dependency on django-registration. django-invitation already verifies the email address of the invitee by virtue of their response to the invite and can therefore register directly, eliminating the redundant django-registration confirmation step.
